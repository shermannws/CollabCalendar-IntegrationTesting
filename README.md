# CollabCalendar - Integration Testing

## Getting Started
In order to use this script, simply clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
To run the integration script, run `node main.js`.

## Purpose
As part of our Orbital Journey in creating the CollabCalendar web application, we wouild like to do integration testing on our codes to ensure that the core functionalities still work as desired even in cases where we add additional components and pages.

## Powered by
In this integration testing script, we use puppeteer to do the testing. Devloped by Google, most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

1) Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
2) Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
3) Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
4) Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
5) Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
6) Test Chrome Extensions.
